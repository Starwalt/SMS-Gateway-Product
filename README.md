With mobile phones becoming popular and Short Message Service (SMS) becoming the most widely used mobile service, 
SMS text messaging is the perfect way to mobile enable enterprise information.

Mobile enabling your enterprise data makes available information, from your enterprise database,
on to your mobile phone using interactive SMS.

Your enterprise information can now be accessible to your customers, as SMS,
even when you are on the road or anywhere away from your desktop.
